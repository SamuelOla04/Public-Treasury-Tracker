reasury Vault Smart Contract
I built a multi-signature treasury system for secure fund management on Ethereum. Multiple managers must approve withdrawals, with daily limits for extra security. Built with Solidity, includes full test coverage, and integrates with MetaMask for easy interaction.
My Role: Smart contract development, testing, and deployment setup.
